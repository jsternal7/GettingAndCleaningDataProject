# GettingAndCleaningDataProject
Project materials for the "Getting and Cleaning Data" Coursera course

Within this repo, you will find the following materials:

1) A R Script entitled "run_analysis.R", which contains the code to acquire, unzip, and clean the accelerometer data for this project, before creating a second dataset that contains the average of all mean and standard deviation measurements.

2) A codebook describing the variables contained within the clean dataset, along with how they were created or manipulated, if necessary.

3) This readme Markdown file.

Per the standards set out in this course, the data in the clean dataset generated by this R script are considered tidy.
